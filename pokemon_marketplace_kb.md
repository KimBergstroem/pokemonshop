# Kim's Pokémon Card Marketplace - Customer Support Knowledge Base

## 1. About the Marketplace

### Kim's Story

Kim, a lifelong Pokémon fan and collector, founded this marketplace with a simple goal: to create a trusted space for collectors to buy and sell high-quality, raw Pokémon cards. Frustrated by the lack of transparency and the prevalence of damaged or misrepresented cards in the market, Kim decided to build a platform where collectors could be confident in the condition of every card they purchase.

### Marketplace Values

*   **Transparency:** We believe in honest and accurate card representation. Our "Only Raw, No Damage, No Whitening and Only Pulled" philosophy is at the core of everything we do.
*   **Quality:** We are committed to offering only the best condition cards. Every card is carefully inspected to ensure it meets our strict quality standards.
*   **Community:** We are more than just a marketplace; we are a community of collectors. We are dedicated to fostering a positive and supportive environment for all Pokémon TCG fans.

### The "Only Raw, No Damage, No Whitening and Only Pulled" Philosophy

This is our promise to you:

*   **Only Raw:** We specialize in raw, ungraded cards. This allows for a more accessible entry point for collectors and provides the opportunity for buyers to grade cards themselves.
*   **No Damage:** We do not sell cards with any visible damage, such as creases, bends, or tears.
*   **No Whitening:** We ensure that all cards have minimal to no whitening on the edges.
*   **Only Pulled:** Our cards are sourced directly from booster packs and have not been played with or handled extensively.

## 2. Card Conditions & Grading

### Raw vs. Graded Cards

*   **Raw Cards:** These are cards that have not been officially graded by a third-party company. They are typically stored in sleeves and toploaders for protection.
*   **Graded Cards:** These are cards that have been sent to a professional grading company (like PSA, BGS, or CGC) to be authenticated, graded, and encapsulated in a protective slab.

### Condition Grades

We use the following grading scale for our raw cards:

| Grade | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **M (Mint)** | A perfect card with no visible flaws. |
| **NM (Near Mint)** | A nearly perfect card with only very minor imperfections, such as a tiny speck of whitening on the back. |
| **LP (Lightly Played)** | A card with minor wear, such as a few light scratches or a small amount of whitening on the edges. |
| **MP (Moderately Played)** | A card with more noticeable wear, such as multiple scratches, moderate edge wear, or a small crease. |
| **HP (Heavily Played)** | A card with significant wear, such as deep scratches, heavy edge wear, or multiple creases. |
| **DMG (Damaged)** | A card with major damage, such as a tear, a large crease, or water damage. |

### Grading Companies

The three most reputable grading companies in the industry are:

*   **PSA (Professional Sports Authenticator):** The most popular and widely recognized grading company.
*   **BGS (Beckett Grading Services):** Known for its detailed sub-grading system.
*   **CGC (Certified Guaranty Company):** A newer player in the market that has quickly gained a strong reputation.

### Quality Factors

When assessing the condition of a card, we look at four key factors:

*   **Centering:** The alignment of the card's artwork and text.
*   **Corners:** The sharpness and condition of the card's corners.
*   **Edges:** The condition of the card's edges, including any whitening or chipping.
*   **Surface:** The smoothness and cleanliness of the card's surface, including any scratches or print lines.
